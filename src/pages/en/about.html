    <p><b>Demoscene</b> — informal movement of digital content creators who produce graphics, music and software
        (demos/intros) — non-interactive presentations of (mostly 3D) graphics calculated in real time. Demoscene
        productions are distributed free of charge and without license limitations. More about the demoscene:</p>

    <p><b>Demoparty</b> — a meeting of demoscene related people and their friends during which competitions are run in
        several categories. Parties have been organized in Poland for 26 years.</p>

    <h2>Why you should submit an entry for Riverwash</h2>

    <p>We think that non-commercial, fair-play competitions are the essence of demoscene and executable prods are the
        gist of it. That is why we have a dedicated compo team who will do everything they can to play and show your
        entry in the best possible way and quality. We have been gathering our hardware and improving our entry workflow
        system for years. You will be able to vote through our dedicated 5stars voter over the network or use an
        oldschool paper vote, all streamlined in order to make the submission, voting and counting as easy and quick as
        possible. Our goals are: quality, no delays, no technical difficulties during the compos and results announced
        on time. We will be publishing our improvements and ideas related to our workflow at our <a
                href="http://facebook.com/riverwashparty">Facebook fanpage</a> until the party starts.</p>

    <h2>Why you should come to Riverwash</h2>

    <p>To bring your entry, of course! But even if you are not taking part in the compos, come to meet demosceners and
        feel the unique atmosphere of a Polish demoparty. We think that our experience of going to Polish and foreign
        parties (for 20 years) and organising them (for 19 years, Riverwash for 10 years) allows us to prepare a good
        experience for demosceners. You can’t judge something you haven’t experienced!</p>

    <h2>What not to expect</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Gaming/retro — if you are just a gamer or retro-user who is not interested in the demoscene, this is not a
            party for you. We recommend to visit another event which focuses on gaming and retro computing, like
            <a href="http://pixelheaven.pl/index_en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pixel Heaven</a>,
            <a href="http://decrunch.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Decrunch</a> or
            <a href="http://retrokomp.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RetroKomp</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Commerce — we do not have sponsors nor we are looking for them. From our experience, commerce and demoscene
            do not mix well and we prefer to keep it clear. That is why you should not expect any high prizes in the
            compos (been there, done that). There is a discount for participants, a memorable cup/statue (pending) for
            the winners and that is all. For us, the demoscene is all about satisfaction and fame (groupies!), not
            money.
        </li>
        <li>Party stream — it is not a technical difficulty for us. We simply think that in order to experience the
            party you should come there in person. Of course we will publish the prods online for those who want to
            watch them afterwards.
        </li>

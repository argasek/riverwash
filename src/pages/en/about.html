    <h1>About party</h1>

    <p>Riverwash is the biggest multi-platform demoparty in Poland running since 2007.</p>

    <h2>Why you should submit an entry for Riverwash?</h2>

    <p>We think that non-commercial, fair-play competitions are the essence of demoscene and executable prods are the gist of it. That is why we have a dedicated compo team who will do everything they can to play and show your entry in the best possible way and quality. We have been gathering our hardware and improving our entry workflow system for years. You will be able to vote through our dedicated 5stars voter over the network or use an oldschool paper vote, all streamlined in order to make the submission, voting and counting as easy and quick as possible. Our goals are: quality, no delays and technical difficulties during the compos and results announced on time. We will be publishing our improvements and ideas related to our workflow at our <a href="http://facebook.com/riverwashparty">Facebook fanpage</a> until the party starts.</p>

    <h2>Why you should come to Riverwash?</h2>

    <p>To bring your entry, of course! But even if you are not taking part in the compos, come to meet demosceners and feel the unique atmosphere of a Polish demoparty. We think that our experience of going to Polish and foreign parties (for 20 years) and organising them (for 18 years, Riverwash for 9 years) allows us to prepare a good experience for demosceners. You can’t judge something you haven’t experienced!</p>

    <h2>What not to expect?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Gaming/retro – if you are just a gamer or retro-user who is not interested in the demoscene, this is not a party for you. We recommend to visit another event which focuses on gaming and retro computing, like Pixel Heaven or RetroKomp.</li>
        <li>Commerce – we do not have sponsors nor we are looking for them. From our experience, commerce and demoscene do not mix well and we prefer to keep it clear. That is why you should not expect any high prizes in the compos (been there, done that). There is a discount for participants, a memorable cup/statue (pending) for the winners and that is all. For us, the demoscene is all about satisfaction and fame (groupies!), not money.</li>
        <li>Party stream – it is not a technical difficulty for us. We simply think that in order to experience the party you should come there in person. Of course we will publish the prods online for those who want to watch them afterwards.</li>
    </ul>

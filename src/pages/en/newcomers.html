    <h1>Free entrance for newcomers</h1>

    <p>
        Newcomers are a rare kind at the demoscene. That's why this year we've prepared a very special promo for all of them.
        We hope you'll like it!

    <h2>How to get a free entrance?</h2>

    <p>
        If you've never been to Riverwash demoparty, this year you can come absolutely for free. <strong>You have to register in
        advance</strong> â€” we won't accept people who just turn up! Send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@riverwash.org">contact@riverwash.org</a>
        with your handle and real name until the end of August. We're going to check if you really are a newcomer to our party and we'll
        confirm your registration. At the entrance, you'll receive a special newcomer ID. It won't allow you to register
        in the system and vote... but don't worry! If you like our party, you'll be able to buy a full ticket for half
        the price (50 PLN) anytime before the compos. This is a one time offer and won't be happening again so see
        you this year!

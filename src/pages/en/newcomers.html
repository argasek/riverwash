    <h1>Free entrance for newcomers</h1>

    <p>
        The promotion of free entrance for newbies surpassed our wildest expectations: over 60 people signed up!
        We are happy that so many of you want to visit us but the capacity of our party place is limited.
        Therefore, we are ending the newcomer registration! Those who have received or will receive a confirmation
        email will still be able to come.
    </p>

        Also please remember to take an ID with a photo so we can identify you at the entrance. Please also remember
        that the party is for adults only. See you on Friday!

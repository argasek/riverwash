    <h1>Music events</h1>

    <p>
        As you probably know, our demoparty is accompanied by a vast amount of excellent music, played both during
        musical competitions, as well as other events (gigs, DJ-sets or jam-sessions). This is what we have for you this year!

    <h2>Yerzmyey &amp; Pinokio</h2>

    <p>With huge pleasure, we are revealing our first live act to happen on Friday's night. Your ears will be tingled by the mellow electronic-chiptune sounds performed live by the absolute demoscene music veterans â€” <strong>Yerzmyey &amp; Pinokio</strong>!</p>

    <p>Although both musicians are strongly connected to the Polish Atari and ZX Spectrum demoscene, you can hear other platforms during their concerts, such as Amiga or Atari Falcon. A fusion of brave drum solos by Pinokio and keyboard mastery of Yerzmyey should please even the most finicky audience. But enough words, listen for yourself:</p>

    <h2>Bassalog</h2>

    <p>After the chiptune madness, later on, Friday evening will be filled with extraordinary sounds of analog synthesizers and digital drums, performed live by an amazing psychedelic girls' duo of Paula and Magda, better known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BassalogOfficial/" target="_blank">Bassalog</a>.</p>

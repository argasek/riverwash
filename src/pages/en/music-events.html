    <h1>Music events</h1>

    <p>
        As you probably know, our demoparty is accompanied by a vast amount of excellent music, played both during
        musical competitions, as well as other events (gigs, DJ-sets or jam-sessions). This is what we have for you this year!

    <h2>Bassalog</h2>

    <p>With a great pleasure we would like to announce our first music event to be held at this year's Riverwash! Friday evening will be filled with extraordinary sounds of analog synthesizers and digital drums, performed live by an amazing psychedelic girls' duo of Paula and Magda, better known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BassalogOfficial/" target="_blank">Bassalog</a>.</p>

    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>“The final cruise”</strong> is our theme this year. We encourage you to
        include the theme in your prod. The best and most clever uses will be rewarded with a sur-prize!
    </p>

    <h2>General rules</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Remote entries are allowed, see <a href="#entries">How to submit your entry</a></li>
        <li>Only new entries, not submitted anywhere else</li>
        <li>No copy / no timbaland / no moroder</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to reject/remove any entries which do not follow the rules or are not demoscene
            related
        </li>
        <li>If your prod violates any Polish or international law, is considered offensive or inappropriate, we can
            disqualify it or exclude it from post-party submission to demoscene archives
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>demo compo (separate for each platform)</li>
        <li>intro compo (separate for each platform)</li>
        <li>graphics (freestyle)</li>
        <li>graphics (pixel)</li>
        <li>music (streaming)</li>
        <li>music (tracked)</li>
        <li>music (chip)</li>
        <li>wild/animation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If any of the platforms has less than 3 entries in any compo, we are going to join demos
        and intros together and, if this is not enough, use the former oldschool / newschool formula. We will also be
        flexible with other compos if they are very popular (separating different kinds of tracker formats if needed,
        etc.), all to make the competitions more exciting. As this is a multiplatform party, any demoscene hardware is
        welcome.</p>

    <h1>How to submit your entry</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Entries at the party should be physically submitted to the compo team (pendrive, USB HDD, CD, floppy) before
            the deadline
        </li>
        <li>Remote entries are allowed but you will not receive the statue as we are not going to send it via post. In
            case of a remote submission, please email us (<a
                href="mailto:contact@riverwash.org">contact@riverwash.org</a>)
            an attachment or a link to a cloud service of your choice. The deadline for remote entries
            is <strong>31.08.2018</strong>.
        </li>

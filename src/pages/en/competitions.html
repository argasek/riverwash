    <h1>Competitions</h1>

    <p>If any of the platforms has less than 3 entries in any compo, we are going to join demos
        and intros together and, if this is not enough, use the former oldschool / newschool formula. We will also be
        flexible with other compos if they are very popular (separating different kinds of tracker formats if needed,
        etc.), all to make the competitions more exciting. As this is a multiplatform party, any demoscene hardware is
        welcome.</p>

    <h1>Competitions</h1>

    <p>After years of joint multiplatform competitions due to the small number of entries, we have noticed an
        improvement trend and we are really happy with that! This year we are introducing <b>separate coded compos</b> for
        every viable platform. If any of the platforms has less than 3 entries in any compo, we are going to join demos
        and intros together and, if this is not enough, use the former oldschool / newschool formula. We will also be
        flexible with other compos if they are very popular (separating different kinds of tracker formats if needed,
        etc.), all to make the competitions more exciting. As this is a multiplatform party, any demoscene hardware is
        welcome.</p>

    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>demo compo (separate for each platform)</li>
        <li>intro compo (separate for each platform)</li>
        <li>graphics (freestyle)</li>
        <li>graphics (pixel)</li>
        <li>music (streaming)</li>
        <li>music (chip)</li>
        <li>wild/animation</li>
        <li>crazy demo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and non-competitive “your old demo compo” (details in <a href="#rules">Rules</a>).</p>

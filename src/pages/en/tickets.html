    <h1>Entrance</h1>

    <p>The last Riverwash is a free demoparty – you don’t pay to enter. Remember, demosceners organize it for other demosceners. Therefore, if you want to take part, you need to follow the rules of conduct.</p>

    <p>If you want to support the last edition anyway, please <a href="mailto:contact@riverwash.org">contact us first</a>.</p>

    <h2>Riverwash 10 Regulations</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Riverwash Demoparty is a non-commercial event we organize as our hobby for other demosceners. If you don’t feel a member of demoscene, you can still take part, however you have to follow the demoscene customs, especially those called collectively „demoscene friendship”. If you don’t know what that means, talk to demosceners first and seek explanation. Breaking the unwritten code may result in getting expelled from the party premises.</li>

      <li>Entrance will be possible only if you show us your valid ID with a photo. We won’t be storing your personal details any further than till the end of the party. After you register, you’ll get a wristband which will enable you to enter the premises (first floor of the restaurant) freely.</li>

      <li>After you register, you will be able to participate in compos, voting, stay in the sleeping room and, if you let us know beforehand through the registration form, have a breakfast on Saturday and Sunday. If you are sure about coming, <a href="/en/participants">register even today</a>!</li>

      <li>The party is for adults only.</li>

      <li>Riverwash is a „100% demoscene, 0% commerce” formula demoparty. It is forbidden to promote, advertise and sell any goods or services (the restaurant offer and Riverwash merchandise are exceptions). We would also like to stress that this is NOT a (retro) gaming event. People running games on their hardware will be asked to stop doing so. Demoscene is about creativity, not playing games.</li>

      <li>In case of any doubts, please feel free to ask us directly at <a href="mailto:contact@riverwash.org">contact@riverwash.org</a>.</li>

    <h1>Music</h1>

    <p>Competitions for the best music on both modern and retro-platforms, divided into 3 categories:</p>

    <h2>Tracked MSX</h2>

    <p>Music made in trackers, samples allowed.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Allowed formats: MOD (Sound/Noise/Fast/ProTracker), XM (Fasttracker II), S3M (ScreamTracker 3), IT (ImpulseTracker),
            DIGI (DigiBooster), AON (Art Of Noise), MED (OctaMED), FC (Future Composer), AHX/THX (AHX), HVL (HivelyTracker),
            DMF (DefleMask), FTM (FamiTracker)</li>

        <li>Format list is open. If you want to submit entry in some other format, please contact us.</li>
        <li>Max filesize 2 MB (2097152 bytes)</li>
        <li>Don't use any packer/cruncher (MO3 etc.).</li>
        <li>We don't allow using formats that use advanced, internal effects (RNS, XRNS, DBM, SKM, MT2, KT)</li>
        <li>Also, your file can't use external plugins and VST (tune will be played on clean installation of chosen tracker).</li>
        <li>To avoid any doubts, please specify the exact name and version of the tracker. In the absence of such
            information, we will try to use the tracker for the native format (MOD &mdash; ProTracker, XM &mdash; Fast Tracker II, etc.)</li>
        <li>Please also provide an MP3 version of the tune (for the lazy listeners :))</li>

        <li>Max playtime &mdash; 3 minutes (entries can be longer but only the initial 3 minutes will be played at the
            party)
        </li>

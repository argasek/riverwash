    <p>Cracow is the second biggest city in Poland, former capital and a
        huge culture centre, located in the south of Poland. Cracow is the most popular destination in Poland for
        foreign tourists as it features numerous world-famous landmarks and sightseeing spots, including the Wawel
        Castle, the salt mine in nearby Wieliczka and many more. Kazimierz district is the heart of nightlife of the
        city with hundreds of cafes, restaurants and pubs.

    <h1>Travelling</h1>

    <p>
    Party place address: <strong>‘Kawiarnia Naukowa’ Pub, Stanisława Żółkiewskiego 19 Street, Cracow</strong> (Wesoła district), Poland
        — see on <a href="https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Stanisława+Żółkiewskiego+19,+Kraków/@50.0594815,19.9579321,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47165b3c47b27d4f:0x4bc615beaaf01fb2">Google Maps</a>.
    </p>

    <p>You can get the party-place:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>by car</strong> — if you come from the west or east, choose the A4 motorway. Motorways in Poland
            aren’t free. If you travel from the west, you’ll have to pay for Wroclaw-Katowice and Katowice-Cracow
            sections (around €4 each, one way). Payments are received at the toll gates, no vignette system. The Cracow
            <a href="http://www.autostrada-a4.pl/drive-site">ring road section and A4</a> eastwards from there is free of charge.
            There is a watched car park nearby and couple of others on Kazimierz district. Prices vary, usually €10-15 a night.
        </li>
        <li><strong>by plane</strong> — there’s an <a href="http://www.krakowairport.pl/en/">airport directly in
            Cracow</a> (not a remote airfield in the middle of nowhere) and the <a
                href="http://krakow.jakdojade.pl/?locale=en">transfer from there to the centre</a> by bus
            (lines: 208, 292, 902), <a href="http://www.krktaxi.pl/en/order_a_taxi_online">taxi</a> and other means
            (private bus service, etc.). We are going to publish a detailed description of this route on our <a
                    href="http://facebook.com/riverwashparty">Facebook page</a> so
            watch that space. You can also fly to <a href="https://www.katowice-airport.com/en">Katowice-Pyrzowice</a>
            (approx. 100 km, ~2h by bus to Cracow)
            or <a href="http://www.lotnisko-chopina.pl/en/passenger?cl=en&set_language=en">Warsaw-Okęcie</a> (approx. 300 km, ~3h by train to Cracow). <b>If
                you need any assistance with travelling, contact us!</b>

                href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/hotel+cracow/">hotels</a>, <a
                href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/hostel+cracow/">hostels</a> and <a
                href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Cracow--Poland">apartments</a> in the city. We do not advertise any of

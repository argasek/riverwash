    Party place address: <strong>‘Caryca’ Pub, Dajwór 16 Street, Cracow</strong> (Kazimierz district), Poland
        — see on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caryca/@50.051001,19.949772,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47165b41ae9462f7:0x772246b464c0e57e">Google Maps</a>.
    </p>

    <p>You can get the party-place:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>by car</strong> — if you come from the west or east, choose the A4 motorway. Motorways in Poland
            aren’t free. If you travel from the west, you’ll have to pay for Wroclaw-Katowice and Katowice-Cracow
            sections (around €4 each, one way). Payments are received at the toll gates, no vignette system. The Cracow
            <a href="http://www.autostrada-a4.pl/drive-site">ring road section and A4</a> eastwards from there is free of charge.
            You can park your car in Kazimierz district, there are multiple watched car parks there, two directly next
            and opposite the party place (Dajwór street). Prices vary, usually €10-15 a night.
        </li>
        <li><strong>by plane</strong> — there’s an <a href="http://www.krakowairport.pl/en/">airport directly in
            Cracow</a> (not a remote airfield in the middle of nowhere) and the <a
                href="http://krakow.jakdojade.pl/?locale=en">transfer from there to the centre</a> by bus
            (lines: 208, 292, 902), <a href="http://www.krktaxi.pl/en/order_a_taxi_online">taxi</a> and other means
            (private bus service, etc.). We are going to publish a detailed description of this route on our <a
                    href="http://facebook.com/riverwashparty">Facebook page</a> so
            watch that space. You can also fly to <a href="https://www.katowice-airport.com/en">Katowice-Pyrzowice</a>
            (approx. 100 km, ~2h by bus to Cracow)
            or <a href="http://www.lotnisko-chopina.pl/en/passenger?cl=en&set_language=en">Warsaw-Okęcie</a> (approx. 300 km, ~3h by train to Cracow). <b>If
                you need any assistance with travelling, contact us!</b>

    <h1>Accommodation</h1>

    <p>You have the following options:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>at the party place</strong> — included in the entrance ticket. There are several sofas and an area
            where you can rest but it will be noisy (as it is in the same room), so earplugs are advised.
        </li>
        <li><strong>near the party place</strong> — literally hundreds of <a
                href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/hotel+cracow/">hotels</a>, <a
                href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/hostel+cracow/">hostels</a> and <a
                href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Cracow--Poland">apartments</a> in the city. We do not advertise any of
            them but if you have problems finding accommodation, we can help.
